KRules is an open source framework that provides, to Python developers, a flexible and fast way to build cloud native applications, 
creating event driven, context aware, and reactive microservices in a Kubernetes cluster.

KRules is build on top of [Knative](https://knative.dev/) and specifically, on its [eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/) part.

Extended documentation is not yet available, but you can take a look at [our introductionary material](https://intro.krules.io).

If you want to start to create your own ruleset, in [krules-project-template](https://github.com/airspot-dev/krules-project-template)
