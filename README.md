KRules is an open source framework that provides, to Python developers, a flexible and fast way to build cloud native applications, 
creating event driven, context aware, and reactive microservices in a Kubernetes cluster.

KRules is build on top of [Knative](https://knative.dev/) and specifically, on its [eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/) part.

Extended documentation is not yet available, but you can take a look at [our introductionary material](https://intro.krules.io).

For a more practical approach, a [tutorial](https://github.com/airspot-dev/krules-tutorial-01-pt1) is available that introduces the fundamental aspects of the framework, 
from the creation of the project to the creation of an event source and some simple rulesets
