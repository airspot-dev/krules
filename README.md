# krules-subjects-redis-storage

KRules is a rules engine primarily intended to run on Kubernetes. 
However the core can be easily used even in different contexts. 
In addition to the core part, you need at least one subject implementation.

This module implements the storage component of the subjects-store based on redis

**NOTE**: the project is at an early stage of development. 
The documentation is not yet available and we do not guarantee
